 The metronome I always wanted.  Handles swing (8ths and 16ths) and can randomly mute itselfâ€“a good way to test your internal time.  Piercing clave sound for loud environments.  Added a nifty swing visualizer.

A good introduction for me to the Web Audio API.

The looper class can handle loops that change on the fly, also.   That'll be cool for later projects!
